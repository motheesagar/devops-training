Ansible:

Iaac = Infrastructure as a code

Cloudformation and Ansible are Iaac

Ansible needs ythhon to be installed in machhine

3 things an Iaac should do:

Provisioning infta -> Terraform can be ued
Configuration management -> Ansible
Server temlate -> Docker

Ansible is not complete Iaac as not all can be achieved with ansible as Ansible has restrictions.

Uually terraform is used to create the code from scratch and Ansible is used to manage the infr created with Terraform.

Ansible and Salt:
>agentless (Need not be installed in slave)
>Push based

Chef and Puppet:
>agent based (Need to be installed in slave machine)
>pull based


Ansible uses Master Slave architecture.

Important files:

Main file of Ansible is called "playbook".

All tasks are assigned in the "playbook".

Public IP of the slave machine is entered in the playbook.

"Control machine" is the master machine or brain of operation.

"Inventory file" or "Hosts" file is where we give IP address to slave machines.

"Module" is a library where we install softwares

Communication between Ansible and Slave machine is SSH protocol.


Install Ansible in Master:

sudo su

sudo yum install python -y

python --version #check if python is installed

yum update -y

sudo yum install wget -y #install wget to download files from web

wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-7-14.noarch.rpm
